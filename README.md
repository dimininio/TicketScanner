Ticket scanner searches for available railway tickets of Ukrainian railway operator (Ukrzaliznitsya).   
Choose the point of depart and destination point, trip date and check the tickets. If the are no free tickets, select type of wagon, number of trains and start searching. The TicketScanner sends a request to the server, checks the tickets every few minutes, and alerts if the tickets are found.

# Building
TicketScanner requires Qt 5.5 and C++ compiler. For higher versions of Qt you should install QtWebKit module in addition, because it deprecated now.
