	1) Network connection break down:
	*check breaking of network during displaying of slash window. (before running of .exe inet was OK, but during "splash" fell)
	*Application is load --> connection is broken --> user click button "Search". Some notification should be.
	*During searching process connection is dropped --> then after some time connection restored automatically.
		Should be some notification, but searching process should be continue automatically after restoring of connection.
	*Before application start, network has been disconnected already.
